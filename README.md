# ‚õè Python Roadmap WebScrapper ‚õè
We aim to make a project that converts all the Python learning steps on the https://roadmap.sh/python website into pdf and downloads them. While doing this, we will also check the download problem repeatedly for possible connection loss scenarios. If you are ready, we can start :)

## üß¨ Requirements
* `Selenium v4.10.0`
* `Pdfkit v1.4`

## Our Goal:
Using this code, we click on each step on this site and download all the steps in each step in order.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

Cloning this repo makes you better developer. Be careful! Especially when naming the files you download as pdf :)
