# ⛏ Python Roadmap WebScrapper ⛏
We aim to make a project that converts all the Python learning steps on the https://roadmap.sh/python website into pdf and downloads them. While doing this, we will also check the download problem repeatedly for possible connection loss scenarios. If you are ready, we can start :)

## 🧬 Requirements
* `Selenium v4.10.0`
* `Pdfkit v1.4`

## Our Goal:
Using this code, we click on each step on this site and download all the steps in each step in order.

## ⚠️ Warning

Cloning this repo makes you better developer. Be careful! Especially when naming the files you download as pdf :)   (If you wonder read below.)

Because the names of the pdfs we download are obtained from the subject headings. If there are symbols such as reverse side lines in the subject title, our string expression misunderstands this and we get an error. We overcame this problem by checking this.
